# tetris-python
Learning python by mimicking [my tetris-ruby repo](https://github.com/sjbecque/tetris-ruby)

![Alt text](screenshot.jpg?raw=true "Tetris browser screenshot")

Demo of some basic python OOP code, and TDD using [mamba](https://github.com/nestorsalceda/mamba) and [expects](https://github.com/jaimegildesagredo/expects).

I still have to finish the websockets/browser part, so now only playable within the terminal.

Type "./run" to start from your termnial.

- left/right: keys "4" and "6"
- rotate left/right: keys "1" and "3"
- quit by hitting "q"
